Due to the nature of this assignment, we will be dealing with relatively newer volcanoes (in which some are still obviously still older than anyone on Earth currently). Each eruption in the database is classified as significant if it meets one or more criteria, such as causing fatalities, incurring **damage on property** (**+$1 million**), reaching a **Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)** of **6 or higher**, generating a tsunami, or being linked to a significant earthquake. The VEI is a scale that measures the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions, providing insight into the magnitude and potential consequences of the eruptions. The database includes detailed information on the location, type of volcano, last known eruption, VEI, casualties, property damage, and much more.\n","![volcano](https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//9/99/Volcano_de_Fuego_Banner.jpg)\n","**We are going to dive straight into these volcanoes (well... their dataset), to swim our way into Pandas proficiency!**\n","\n","You will find the [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) helpful.
